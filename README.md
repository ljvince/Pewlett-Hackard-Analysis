#### Q:Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

###### A: I donâ€™t thing there isn't enough qualified, retirement-ready employees can be the mentor of next-gen of employees, because the number of these employees by filter born from 1965 is only 1,549.
###### as we know that 72,458 employees will retiring. and 72,458/1,549 =46.77. these mentor need to training about 10 new hire employees a year for 5 years.

## proposal
#### 1.In order to make the mentorship program more effective, increase the range by filter employees who born from 1962 to 1965, as the picture below,  there is 56859 employees could be join in the mentorship plan, and also in this group employees, we have 20314 + 19583 = 39897 employees have senior titles.they could training new stuff better, and still if someone call off or on a break, we also have more mentor could covered each others.

#### 2.re-employ after retirement for mentorship plan. in this case we can re-employed the people who retired just for training new stuff. It's a pay-less-get-more deal.
